# TelemetryTracker
 The Telemetry Tracker project consists of monitoring, collecting and managing telemetry sensor data. Its main goal is to develop an application that facilitates the visualization and management of sensor data in a user-friendly and efficient manner.


Telemetry refers to the process of collecting, transmitting, and receiving data from remote sources, typically sensors, and transmitting it for monitoring, analysis, and decision-making.
This project focuses on finding a solution that enables the user to interact with sensor data, providing features such as data visualization, data storage, adding, editing and deleting sensor data, moreover searching for a particular sensor through the sensor JSON file that a user can load and edit.
The telemetry focuses on monitoring and optimizing the performance and safety of vehicles. Among the key sensors chosen for this project are the tire pressure sensor, the brake temperature sensor and lastly the fuel flow sensor, each playing a critical role in enhancing the vehicle performance, efficiency and safety.
The tire pressure sensor, a vital component of modern automotive systems, monitors tire pressure levels. The remaining sensors, that is the brake temperature sensor and the fuel flow sensor monitor the brake temperature levels and the flow rate consumption of a vehicle.
The sensors can be created or loaded through a JSON file through the specific Open file button, and can be selected from a sensor panel where they are listed vertically. The user can select a specific sensor from the list and he can visualize it on the chart displayed on the right. The chart shows the numeric values of the sensors on the y axis in relation to the timestamp on the x axis.
The user can search for sensors through a search bar shown above the sensor panel, and the number of search results can be seen in the status bar; the matching sensors are updated dynamically whenever the user makes a research.
